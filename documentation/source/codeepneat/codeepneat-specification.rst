CoDeepNEAT Specification
========================

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

.. note:: This documentation solely lists the algorithm & encoding specifications without concerning itself with the validity or potential of the specific choices that make up the CoDeepNEAT method.

.. warning::  This documentation outlines the CoDeepNEAT algorithm & encoding specifications as understood by the TFNE project. While the TFNE project aims to stay as close as possible to the original specification, does it also aim to be a superset of the configuration options of the original specification. This specification also concretizes the algorithm specification if the original specification is too vague and no code was supplied. If you find an issue with the specification or the implementation details please contact tfne@paulpauls.de. Thank you.

CoDeepNEAT Encoding
-------------------

* Details about blueprints, modules, etc.
* How a genome is made up of blueprints and modules and how the Model is build
  from them
* Include short references to variables
* SubSubHeadings are made up of BP/Modules/Genomes, etc
