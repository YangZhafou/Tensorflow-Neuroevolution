SubGraphNeat/-DeepNEAT Overview
====================================

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

The SubGraphNEAT/-DeepNEAT method is a neuroevolution under development by the Tensorflow-Neuroevolution project. It's goal is to replicate the exploitation of repetitive structure in the problem domain that is inherent in the CoDeepNEAT algorithm, while enabling more dynamic module creation. Instead of limiting the modules to predefined complexity and configuration does SubGraphNEAT/-DeepNEAT allow for the modules to be evolved freely through the NEAT or DeepNEAT neuroevolution methods.


.. note:: This documentation solely lists the algorithm & encoding specifications without concerning itself with the validity or potential of the specific choices that make up the SubGraphNEAT/-DeepNEAT method.
